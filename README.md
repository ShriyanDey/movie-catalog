To start the react app, got into the '/movie-catalog' file on yout terminal or command line and type
    npm run start
(made sure to have node installed)

Then, opena  new terminal or cmd and in the same director, type
    npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
(This command connects the local JSON file that I use as a database to the app)
